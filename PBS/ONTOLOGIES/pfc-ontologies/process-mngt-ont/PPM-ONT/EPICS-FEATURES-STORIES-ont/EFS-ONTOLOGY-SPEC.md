# Epic-Features-Stories (EFS) Ontology Specification

## Overview

The Epic-Features-Stories (EFS) Ontology provides a modular, Schema.org-grounded semantic framework for managing the complete idea-to-execution lifecycle in product development. It is designed as a pluggable component that integrates with:

- **Value Proposition Ontology** (upstream) - Connecting product specifications to value delivery
- **Product-Market Fit (PMF) Ontology** (parallel) - Validating market alignment
- **Go-To-Market (GTM) Ontology** (downstream) - Enabling market launch coordination

## Design Principles

### 1. Modular Architecture
The ontology is organised into discrete modules that can be deployed independently based on organisational maturity and needs. Core modules provide essential functionality; extension modules add capabilities progressively.

### 2. Schema.org Foundation
All classes extend Schema.org base types, ensuring semantic interoperability and compatibility with existing knowledge graph infrastructure.

### 3. Integration-First Design
Explicit integration interfaces define connection points to external ontologies, enabling seamless value flow from strategy to market.

### 4. Lean/Agile Alignment
The specification embeds lean principles (hypothesis validation, MVP, iterative delivery) and agile practices (sprints, velocity, acceptance criteria) as first-class concepts.

## Module Definitions

### Core Modules (Required)

#### BacklogManagement
The foundational module providing Epic-Feature-Story hierarchy and backlog operations.

**Classes:** BacklogItem, Epic, Feature, UserStory, Enabler, Task
**Dependencies:** None

#### ValueDelivery
Connects delivery work to business outcomes and benefits.

**Classes:** Outcome, Benefit
**Dependencies:** BacklogManagement
**External Integration:** pmf:ValueProposition, vsom:StrategicObjective

### Extension Modules (Optional)

| Module | Purpose | Dependencies | External Integration |
|--------|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| StrategicAlignment | Theme, capability, and strategy mapping | BacklogManagement, ValueDelivery | vsom:StrategicInitiative |
| ExecutionManagement | Sprint, task, and team execution | BacklogManagement | - |
| ReleaseManagement | Release planning and market readiness | BacklogManagement, ExecutionManagement | gtm:LaunchPlan |
| ValueValidation | Hypothesis testing and lean validation | BacklogManagement, ValueDelivery | pmf:ProductMarketFit |
| QualityAssurance | Acceptance criteria and test automation | BacklogManagement | - |
| RiskManagement | Risk identification and mitigation | BacklogManagement | - |
| DependencyManagement | Inter-item dependencies | BacklogManagement | - |
| UserExperience | Personas and jobs-to-be-done | BacklogManagement | pmf:CustomerSegment |
| CapabilityDelivery | Business capability mapping | BacklogManagement, StrategicAlignment | - |
| TeamManagement | Team structure and capacity | ExecutionManagement | - |
| StakeholderManagement | Stakeholder mapping | BacklogManagement | - |
| TechnicalDebt | Tech debt and enablers | BacklogManagement | - |

## Integration Interfaces

### 1. Value Proposition Interface

Connects EFS to the upstream Value Proposition ontology, ensuring features deliver articulated value.

```
efs:Benefit --contributes--> pmf:ValueElement
efs:Feature --delivers--> pmf:ValueProposition
efs:Outcome --validates--> pmf:ValueProposition
```

**Use Case:** When defining features, map each to specific value proposition elements to ensure market alignment.

### 2. Product-Market Fit Interface

Enables hypothesis-driven development aligned with PMF validation.

```
efs:Hypothesis --validates--> pmf:FitValidation
efs:Persona --represents--> pmf:CustomerSegment
efs:UserStory --addresses--> pmf:CustomerNeed
```

**Use Case:** Track hypothesis validation status to inform PMF confidence scoring.

### 3. Go-To-Market Interface

Connects release planning to market launch activities.

```
efs:Release --triggers--> gtm:LaunchPlan
efs:Feature --supports--> gtm:ProductMessage
efs:Capability --enables--> gtm:DifferentiationPoint
```

**Use Case:** Release milestones trigger GTM preparation activities; feature capabilities inform market positioning.

### 4. VSOM Strategic Interface

Ensures product work aligns with strategic objectives.

```
efs:Epic --achieves--> vsom:StrategicObjective
efs:Theme --aligns--> vsom:StrategicInitiative
efs:Outcome --measures--> vsom:StrategicKPI
efs:Capability --maps--> vsom:OperationalCapability
```

**Use Case:** Epics trace to strategic objectives; outcomes contribute to strategic KPI measurement.

## Implementation Guidance

### Minimum Viable Implementation

For initial deployment, implement only core modules:

1. **BacklogManagement** - Essential Epic-Feature-Story structure
2. **ValueDelivery** - Outcome and benefit tracking

This provides foundation for basic product management with value alignment.

### Progressive Enhancement Path

```
Phase 1: BacklogManagement + ValueDelivery
    ↓
Phase 2: + StrategicAlignment + QualityAssurance
    ↓
Phase 3: + ExecutionManagement + TeamManagement
    ↓
Phase 4: + ReleaseManagement (GTM integration ready)
    ↓
Phase 5: + ValueValidation (PMF integration ready)
    ↓
Phase 6: + Full module deployment
```

# Willingness to Pay Customer Interview Framework
## Product-Market Fit Testing Methodology

### Overview
This framework guides systematic customer interviews to validate willingness to pay (WTP) as a key indicator of product-market fit. The process is designed for AI/automation solutions targeting enterprise and SMB markets.

### Pre-Interview Preparation

#### Participant Screening Criteria

- **Problem Alignment**: Currently experiencing the problem your solution addresses
- **Budget Authority**: Has visibility into or influence over relevant budgets
- **Timing**: Actively seeking solutions or planning initiatives in next 6-12 months

#### Interview Setup
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes
- **Format**: Video call (for better rapport and non-verbal cues)
- **Recording**: With permission, for analysis and pattern identification
- **Preparation**: Review company background, current solutions, recent initiatives

### Interview Structure

# BAIV MVP1.2 Process Implementation Framework
*Connecting Process Ontology to Strategic Frameworks and OKR Execution*

## Executive Summary

The BAIV MVP1.2 Process Ontology provides operational clarity for executing customer acquisition and PMF validation while remaining distinct from strategic frameworks. This implementation framework bridges the gap between high-level strategy (VSOM) and tactical execution (P0-P16 agents).

## 1. Framework Distinctions

### Strategic Frameworks (VSOM/PMF)
- **Purpose**: Vision, strategy, and market positioning
- **Scope**: Long-term competitive advantage
- **Governance**: Board and C-suite oversight
- **Metrics**: Market share, revenue growth, strategic positioning

### Process Frameworks (BAIV MVP1.2)
- **Purpose**: Operational execution and customer delivery
- **Scope**: Day-to-day business operations
- **Governance**: Functional management and teams
- **Metrics**: Process efficiency, customer satisfaction, quality

## 2. Customer Acquisition Process Design

### Batch Processing Strategy
Based on your 3,426 target organizations:

```
Batch Structure:
├── 35 batches of 100 companies each
├── Final batch of 26 companies
├── Industry stratification per batch
└── PMF validation per segment
```

### Industry Prioritization Matrix

| Industry | Count | % | Batch Priority | PMF Readiness |
|----------|-------|---|----------------|---------------|
| Technology | 420 | 12.3% | High | High - Digital native |
| HVAC | 250 | 7.3% | High | Medium - Traditional but service-focused |
| Construction | 70 | 2.0% | Medium | Low - Traditional industry |
| Engineering | 62 | 1.8% | Medium | High - Technical sophistication |
| Fire Protection | 42 | 1.2% | Medium | Medium - Compliance-driven |
| Other | 2,503 | 73.1% | Segmented | Variable - Requires classification |

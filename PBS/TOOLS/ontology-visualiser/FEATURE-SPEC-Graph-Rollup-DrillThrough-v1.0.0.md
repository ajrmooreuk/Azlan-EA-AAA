# Feature Spec: Graph Rollup, Drill-Through & Database Integration

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Draft
**Relates to:** BACKLOG.md Epic 2, HLD Features F1/F3/F6

---

## Overview

Extend the Ontology Visualiser from a single-ontology viewer into a multi-layer graph platform capable of:

1. **Rollup View** — Aggregate meta-graph showing all 23 ontologies across 6 series as a graph-of-graphs
2. **Top-Down Drill-Through** — Navigate from series layer down through individual ontologies to entity-level detail
3. **Cross-Ontology Connections** — Detect and render relationships that span ontology boundaries, with lineage chain visualisation
4. **Supabase Integration** — Persist ontologies, graph data, and validation state in a shared database

These capabilities transform the visualiser from a file-by-file inspection tool into an enterprise knowledge graph navigator.

## Feature 1: Series Rollup View (Tier 0)

### Description

A meta-graph where each node represents an ontology series and edges represent cross-series dependencies. This is the entry point when loading the full library.

### Rollup Node Structure

Each series node displays:

| Field | Source | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Label | `seriesRegistry[key].name` | "Value Engineering Series" |
| Count | `seriesRegistry[key].ontologies.length` | 6 |
| Compliance | Aggregate from entries | "5/6 compliant" |
| Badge | Compliance ratio | Green (100%), Yellow (>50%), Red (<50%) |

### Rollup Edge Structure

Edges between series nodes are derived from cross-ontology references declared in individual ontology definitions. Detection logic:

1. For each ontology, scan `relationships[].rangeIncludes` and `crossOntologyReferences`
2. If a reference uses a namespace prefix belonging to a different series, create an edge
3. Edge weight = count of cross-references between the two series

### Known Cross-Series Relationships

| From Series | To Series | Key Relationships |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| VE (VSOM) | PE (PPM) | `vsom:cascadesTo` → `okr:Objective` |
| VE (OKR) | VE (VP) | `okr:drivesValueProposition` |
| VE (VP) | VE (PMF) | `vp:validatedBy` → `pmf:FitAssessment` |
| VE (PMF) | PE (EFS) | `pmf:decomposesInto` → `efs:Service` |
| PE (PPM) | PE (PE) | `ppm:executedVia` → `pe:Process` |
| PE (PE) | PE (EFS) | `pe:implements` → `efs:Service` |
| PE (EFS) | PE (EA) | `efs:architectedBy` → `ea:ArchitectureComponent` |
| Foundation (ORG-CTX) | VE (VSOM) | `org-ctx:strategicContext` → `vsom:Vision` |
| Foundation (ORG-CTX) | Competitive | `org-ctx:competitivePosition` → `ca:Analysis` |
| Foundation (RRR) | VE + PE | Bridges via RACI/RBAC role mappings |
| Security (MCSB) | PE (EA) | `mcsb:assessedComponent` → `ea:ArchitectureComponent` |
| Orchestration (EMC) | All | `emc:composes` all other ontologies |

### VE Lineage Chain

The primary strategic flow rendered as a highlighted path in Tier 0:

```
VSOM → OKR → VP → PMF → EFS
  "Vision cascades to Objectives, which drive Value Propositions,
   validated by Product-Market Fit, decomposed into Enterprise Services"
```

### PE Lineage Chain

The primary execution flow:

```
PPM → PE → EFS → EA
  "Portfolios execute via Processes, implementing Services,
   governed by Architecture"
```

### User Stories

| ID | Story | Points |
|----|-------|--------|
| R.1.1 | As a user, I want to see all 6 ontology series as nodes in a rollup graph when I load the full library | 5 |
| R.1.2 | As a user, I want edges between series nodes showing cross-series dependencies with labels | 5 |
| R.1.3 | As a user, I want each series node to show ontology count and compliance status as a badge | 3 |
| R.1.4 | As a user, I want the VE lineage chain (VSOM→OKR→VP→PMF→EFS) highlighted as a distinct path | 3 |
| R.1.5 | As a user, I want the PE lineage chain (PPM→PE→EFS→EA) highlighted as a distinct path | 3 |
| R.1.6 | As a user, I want to toggle between "Series View" (6 nodes) and "Ontology View" (23 nodes) at Tier 0 | 3 |
| R.1.7 | As a user, I want EMC (Orchestration) shown as a central hub connecting to all other series | 2 |

---

## Feature 2: Top-Down Drill-Through (Tier 0 → Tier 1 → Tier 2)

### Description

Click a series node in Tier 0 to expand into its constituent ontologies (Tier 1). Click an ontology node to see its entities and relationships (existing single-ontology view). Click an entity to open the detail panel (Tier 2).

### Navigation Model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph NAV["Breadcrumb Navigation"]
        BC["Library > VE-Series > VSOM > StrategicObjective"]
    end

    subgraph ACTIONS["Available Actions"]
        BACK["← Back (breadcrumb click)"]
        DRILL["→ Drill (node click)"]
        XLINK["↗ Cross-link (dashed edge click)"]
        HOME["⌂ Home (return to Tier 0)"]
    end

    NAV --> ACTIONS
```

### Drill-Through Behaviour

| Action | From | To | Animation |
|--------|------|----|-----------|
| Click series node | Tier 0 | Tier 1: show ontologies in that series as individual graphs side-by-side | Zoom-into transition, series node expands |
| Click ontology node | Tier 1 | Tier 1 (expanded): full entity-relationship graph for that ontology | Node expands inline, other ontologies fade to 30% opacity |
| Click entity node | Tier 1 | Tier 2: detail panel slides in from right | Panel animation, graph dims |
| Click cross-ontology edge | Tier 1 | Tier 1: navigate to target ontology, highlight target entity | Pan + zoom to target, breadcrumb updates |
| Click breadcrumb | Any | Navigate back to that tier level | Reverse animation |
| Home button | Any | Tier 0 | Zoom-out to rollup |

### Context Preservation

When drilling down, the parent context is preserved:
- Tier 0 → Tier 1: Other series remain visible but faded (30% opacity), clickable to switch
- Tier 1 expanded: Other ontologies in the same series remain as collapsed nodes
- Tier 2: Graph remains visible behind the detail panel

### User Stories

| ID | Story | Points |
|----|-------|--------|
| D.2.1 | As a user, I want to click a series node to drill into its ontologies | 5 |
| D.2.2 | As a user, I want to click an ontology to expand its entity graph inline | 5 |
| D.2.3 | As a user, I want breadcrumb navigation showing my current position in the hierarchy | 3 |
| D.2.4 | As a user, I want a Home button to return to the Tier 0 rollup from any depth | 1 |
| D.2.5 | As a user, I want parent-level context preserved (faded) when I drill down | 3 |
| D.2.6 | As a user, I want smooth transitions (zoom/fade) when navigating between tiers | 3 |
| D.2.7 | As a user, I want to click a cross-ontology edge to navigate to the target ontology | 3 |

## Feature 3: Cross-Ontology Connection Rendering

### Description

Detect and render relationships that span ontology boundaries. These exist in three forms:

1. **Namespace-prefixed references** — `rangeIncludes: ["okr:Objective"]` in the VSOM ontology references an entity in the OKR ontology
2. **Explicit crossOntology declarations** — `"crossOntology": true` on relationship definitions
3. **Shared entity names** — Same `@id` appearing in multiple ontology definitions (e.g., `RoleContext` in both VSOM and RRR)

### Cross-Reference Detection Algorithm

```
FOR each loaded ontology O:
  FOR each relationship R in O.relationships:
    FOR each target T in R.rangeIncludes:
      IF T contains namespace prefix P where P != O.namespace:
        CREATE cross-ontology edge {
          source: O.namespace + ":" + R.domainIncludes[0],
          target: T,
          edgeType: "cross-ontology",
          label: R.name,
          sourceOntology: O.name,
          targetOntology: resolve(P)
        }
  FOR each entity E in O.entities:
    IF E has "extends" or "references" pointing to external namespace:
      CREATE cross-ontology edge (inheritance or reference type)
```

### Edge Styling

| Edge Type | Style | Colour | Label |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Intra-ontology relationship | Solid | Series colour | Relationship name |
| Cross-ontology reference | Dashed | Grey (#888) | Relationship name + target namespace |
| Inheritance (extends) | Dotted with arrow | Blue (#4A90D9) | "extends" |
| Lineage chain (VE/PE) | Thick solid | Gold (#D4A843) | Chain step label |
| Bridge node connection | Dash-dot | Purple (#9B59B6) | "bridge" |

### Bridge Node Detection

A bridge node is an entity that appears in or is referenced by 3+ ontologies. Examples:

| Entity | Ontologies | Role |
|--------|------------|------|
| `rrr:RoleContext` | VSOM, PPM, PE, ORG | Role assignments across all domains |
| `efs:Service` | PMF, PE, EA, EFS | Core service abstraction |
| `org-ctx:OrganizationContext` | ORG-CTX, VSOM, CA, CL, GA | Central context hub |

Bridge nodes get a distinct visual treatment:
- Double border (inner series colour, outer gold)
- Larger node size (1.5x)
- Tooltip showing all referencing ontologies

### User Stories

| ID | Story | Points |
|----|-------|--------|
| X.3.1 | As a user, I want cross-ontology edges rendered with dashed styling distinct from intra-ontology edges | 3 |
| X.3.2 | As a user, I want the VE lineage chain (VSOM→OKR→VP→PMF→EFS) rendered as a highlighted path I can follow | 5 |
| X.3.3 | As a user, I want the PE lineage chain (PPM→PE→EFS→EA) rendered as a highlighted path | 3 |
| X.3.4 | As a user, I want bridge nodes (entities referenced by 3+ ontologies) highlighted with a special indicator | 3 |
| X.3.5 | As a user, I want to filter the graph to show only cross-ontology edges (hiding intra-ontology detail) | 3 |
| X.3.6 | As a user, I want the Audit panel to report cross-ontology dependency counts per ontology | 3 |
| X.3.7 | As a user, I want to click a cross-ontology edge to navigate to the target ontology and highlight the target entity | 3 |
| X.3.8 | As a user, I want a "Connection Map" mode showing only cross-ontology edges as a dependency diagram | 5 |

## Feature 4: Supabase Database Integration

### Description

Connect the visualiser to Supabase as the backing store for ontologies, graph data, and validation state. Follows the HLD Option A (Supabase-First) architecture with an offline fallback to IndexedDB.

### Schema

Uses the schema defined in `HLD-VISUALISER-ENHANCED-v1.0.0.md` with additions for rollup and cross-ontology data:

CREATE INDEX idx_cross_edges_target ON cross_ontology_edges(target_ontology_id);
```

### Connection Modes

| Mode | Data Source | Writes | Use Case |
|------|------------|--------|----------|
| **Online** | Supabase primary, IndexedDB cache | Supabase + IndexedDB | Normal operation |
| **Offline** | IndexedDB only | IndexedDB only | No network / Supabase not configured |
| **File-only** | Loaded JSON files | None (read-only) | Quick inspection, no persistence |

### Sync Behaviour

    style FILE fill:#f0e7fe,stroke:#6f0eb0
```

### Import Pipeline

When connecting to Supabase for the first time:

1. Read `ont-registry-index.json` from the repository
2. For each entry, load the full ontology definition from its `path`
3. Insert into `ontologies` table with `series` and `layer` populated from `seriesRegistry`
4. Denormalize entities into `graph_nodes` and relationships into `graph_edges`
5. Run cross-reference detection to populate `cross_ontology_edges`
6. Mark `is_cross_ontology = true` on relevant `graph_edges` rows

### Supabase Edge Functions

| Function | Purpose | Trigger |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `resolve-graph` | Fetch ontologies + nodes + edges for a given tier/series | GET from visualiser |
| `validate-ontology` | Run OAA gates on upload | POST on ontology save |
| `detect-cross-refs` | Scan all ontologies for cross-references | POST on library import |
| `rollup-stats` | Aggregate compliance/count stats per series | GET for Tier 0 render |

### User Stories

| ID | Story | Points |
|----|-------|--------|
| DB.4.1 | As a user, I want the visualiser to connect to Supabase and load ontologies from the database | 5 |
| DB.4.2 | As a user, I want the visualiser to fall back to IndexedDB when Supabase is unavailable | 3 |
| DB.4.3 | As a user, I want to import the full ontology library from the repository into Supabase | 5 |

## Open Questions

| # | Question | Options | Impact |
|---|----------|---------|--------|
| Q1 | Graph performance at 23 ontologies (~200+ nodes, ~400+ edges) | vis.js can handle this; may need clustering at full entity expansion | Phase 2 |
| Q2 | Should Tier 0 default to Series View (6 nodes) or Ontology View (23 nodes)? | Series view recommended as default — cleaner entry point | Phase 1 |
| Q3 | Should placeholder ontologies (KPI, MCSB2, AIR, GDPR, AZALZ) appear in the rollup? | Yes, with "placeholder" badge — shows intended scope | Phase 1 |
| Q4 | Supabase project: new dedicated project or extend existing ds-e2e-prototype schema? | Recommend new project — ontology data is distinct from design system | Phase 4 |
| Q5 | Should the import pipeline run as a one-off CLI script or as a visualiser UI action? | Both: CLI for initial import, UI "Sync from Repo" button for updates | Phase 4 |

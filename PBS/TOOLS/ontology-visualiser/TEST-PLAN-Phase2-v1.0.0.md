# Test Plan — Phase 2: Series Rollup View & Drill-Through Navigation

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-05
**PR:** #45
**Feature Spec:** FEATURE-SPEC-Graph-Rollup-DrillThrough-v1.0.0.md (Features 1 & 2)
**ADR:** ADR-010 (Accepted)
**Branch:** `feature/phase-2-rollup-drillthrough`

---

## Scope

Phase 2 adds three-tier progressive disclosure navigation to the multi-ontology registry view:

- **Tier 0** — Series Rollup: 6 series super-nodes (default entry point)
- **Tier 1** — Series Drill-Down: Ontology nodes within a selected series
- **Tier 2** — Entity Graph: Full entity-level graph for a single ontology

Also includes a bug fix for cross-reference property name detection in `multi-loader.js`.

## Pass Criteria

- All TC-1 (regression) tests pass — no single-ontology functionality broken
- All TC-2 (Tier 0) tests pass — series rollup renders correctly
- All TC-3 (Tier 1) tests pass — series drill-down works with context nodes
- All TC-4 (Tier 2) tests pass — entity drill-down reuses single-ontology renderer
- All TC-5 (bug fix) tests pass — both `keyBridges` and `crossOntology` detected
- All TC-6 (breadcrumb) tests pass — navigation is consistent and reliable
- All TC-7 (aggregation) tests pass — series-level edges are correct
- All TC-8 (visual) tests pass — styling matches design specification

# OAA - Ontology Architect Agent

## Purpose

The Ontology Architect Agent (OAA) ensures semantic consistency across all domain models and manages ontology evolution.

## Responsibilities

1. **Design Consistency** - All ontologies follow consistent patterns
2. **Semantic Alignment** - Terms and relationships are coherent across domains
3. **Version Control** - Ontology evolution is managed and documented
4. **Integration Patterns** - Cross-ontology relationships are well-defined
5. **Validation** - New ontology additions meet quality standards

## Ontology Domains

| Domain | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Azure Resources** | Cloud resource taxonomy |
| **Assessment** | WAF, CAF assessment models |
| **Organisation** | Org structure, roles, capabilities |
| **Security** | MCSB, compliance frameworks |
| **Cost** | Cost models, optimisation |

## Patterns

- JSON Schema for validation
- RDF/OWL for semantic web compatibility
- GraphQL for queryable ontologies
